## Problem Statement

Create a docker container from the httpd image in a customized network. The new container needs to be accessible on port 8082 on the host. The container should have the capability of persisting the data even if the Docker Daemon goes down. The containers default page should show as "Welcome to CloudThat Docker training".

Hint: The default page of httpd image is located at `/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/`
